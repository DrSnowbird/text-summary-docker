# Text Summary using Google's PageRank algorithm
#

# Run example
```
python3 bert-text-summary-pypi.py -d ./data-bert-text-summary-pypi.txt
```

# Performance
* It takes about few seconds to run a page of text to generate the summary using desktop 8-core CPU.
* However, this is less powerful than Bert-Extractive-Summarizer algorithm to produce more cohesive summarization.

# Scaling
* It will need faster processors (CPU or GPU) to provide more near real-time on-line performance in seconds.
