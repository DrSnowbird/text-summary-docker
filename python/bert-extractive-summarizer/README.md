# Text Summary using Bert-Extractive-Summarizer from PyPi
#

# Run example
```
python3 bert-text-summary-pypi.py -d ./data-bert-text-summary-pypi.txt
```

# Performance
* It takes about 35 seconds to run a page of text to generate the summary using desktop 8-core CPU.
* May need to find out tuning parameters for the hardware.

# Scaling
* It will need faster processors (CPU or GPU) to provide more near real-time on-line performance in seconds.
